                We are always looking for ways to make Hotglue better. There are a few key things you can do to make that happen.
            </p>
            <h1>Bugs</h1>
            <p>
                While we feel like the current release is pretty stable, we know people are going to run into issues that we might not have come across yet. If you find a bug, the best way to help is fix is it to <a href="https://github.com/sprucemedia/hotglue/issues/new" target="_blank">submit a bug ticket</a>. Before doing so, please look at the current bugs to ensure you aren't submitting a duplicate bug. If this is indeed a new bug, please provide us with as much information as possible to help us replicate it and fix it quickly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are feeling extra helpful, why not fix the bug yourself, then submit a pull request so that we can get the fix out to everyone as soon as possible.
            </p>

            <h1>Suggestions and Comments</h1>
            <p>
                Have an idea on how we can improve Hotglue? It could be an anything from an additional feature to a suggestion on how to improve stability and performance. Open an <a href="https://github.com/sprucemedia/hotglue/issues/new" target="_blank">issue with a suggestion ticket</a> and lets start a discussion on how to improve Hotglue for everyone.
            </p>

            <h1>Plugins</h1>
            <p>
                We like having options, that's one of the reasons we created Hotglue. If you have a Framework you would like supported, a compiler you would like to use, or a template engine you prefer for rendering, why not fork the project on github and create it.
                We'll be adding some additional information in the documentation soon for how to extend Hotglue for each of the plug-in types, but in the meantime, the code should be separated enough so you can easily add a new plug-in without too much trouble. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are having trouble extending Hotglue for a specific feature, let us know and we might be able to help you quickly get your feature off the ground.
            </p>
