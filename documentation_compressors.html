<h1>Compressors</h1>

<h2>Default</h2>

<p>
    By default, Hotglue will bundle all referenced files together when the project is set to release mode, but not compress the files. If you want to add compression to your project, you can install one or more compressor plug-ins. It is recommended that you only install one compressor plug-in to avoid any compatibility issues. If you install more than compressor plug-in, they will all run, but the results could be unpredictable.  
</p>

<p>
    There isn't any configuration options available for the compressors at this time. The compressors will only run when the project is set to release mode, never in debug mode. To view which compressors are available go to the <a href="plugins.html">plug-ins</a> page.
