<h1>Page References Details</h1>

<p>
    In order to get script references onto your page, you need to reference a script file through the Hotglue library. When you reference a script file, below is a detailed explanation of what happens behind the scenes on a page load.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Find and parse all Hotglue <em>library</em> and <em>require</em> references</li>
    <li>Build a list of all required files, by going through the reference dependency chain</li>
    <li>Remove any duplicate <em>library</em> and <em>require</em> references</li>
    <li>Ensure there aren't any circular references</li>
    <li>Order references to load from no required child references, to no parent references</li>
    <li>Generate all script references and write them to the page</li>
</ol>

<p>
    After this process has happened for the first time, the found references and any compiled scripts are cached. On subsequent page loads, the cached versions are served up. If any of the files have changed since they were last cached, the process starts again listed above.
</p>

<h1>Script Reference</h1>

<p>
    Hotglue works best, at the moment, when there is a single call to <code>HotGlue.Script.Reference</code>. However, you can include multiple files in that single call.
</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
    <%= HotGlue.Script.Reference("Accounts/app.js", "Accounts/dialog.js") %>
</pre>  

<p>
    This will generate a complete <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.
</p>

<p>
    You can optionally remove the surrounding tag and reference code if you'd prefer to write this yourself by passing a <code>HelperOptions</code> object.
</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $LAB // Must add reference manually when GenerateHeaderAndFooter = false
        <%: HotGlue.Script.Reference(new HotGlue.Model.HelperOptions { GenerateHeaderAndFooter = false }, "global.js") %>
            .wait(function () {
                // some custom JS code we need to include
            });
    </script>
</pre>
